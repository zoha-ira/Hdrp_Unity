To get started, please confirm that you have these packages installed:

--- Input System ---

Already included in Unity 6 templates.
Used for Active Input Handling.
Version 1.11.2 or newer.
Required for vehicle control.

--- Cinemachine (3.1.2 or newer) ---

Used for camera controls.
Please keep in mind that in order to install the latest version you need Unity 6+. 
This can be ignored if you will make your own camera and it's controls, or you use older versions of Unity Editor (2021-2023).
Make sure that the version is 3.1.2 or newer.
Mostly because after 3.0 version Cinemachine got huge overhaul, and older versions use different components and won't be supported.

--- TextMeshPro ---

Already included in Unity, only essential resources required.
Used for speed and current gear display on dashboard and overlay UI.

How to import TextMeshPro essential resources:
Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources.
